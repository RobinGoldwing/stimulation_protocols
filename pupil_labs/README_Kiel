3. activate the environment:

	conda activate pupil_labs

4: run the experiment:

	python stim_emotibit_cal_before.py C:\Users\LScholtus\Archeo\XSCAPE\Automatic_EXP\screen_stimulus_presentation\EXP

5. follow instruction on the screen

6. Copy Pupil capture console into a txt file


To stop the experiment if something is wrong ctr + c



If problems with step 4 you can also follow this procedure

	- type in:

	python stim_emotibit_window_min_calibration.py C:\Users\LScholtus\Archeo\XSCAPE\Automatic_EXP\screen_stimulus_presentation\EXP

		- press enter to start calibration
		- type ok even if no calibration started
		- launch calibration from Pupil Capture
		- if calibration ok type start in Miniconda
