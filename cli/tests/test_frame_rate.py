# Part of the XSCAPE Project (Experimental Science for Cognitive and Perceptual Exploration)
#
# Developed by:
#   - Arturo-José Valiño
#   - Rubén Álvarez-Mosquera
#
# This software is designed to facilitate the creation, execution, and analysis
# of neuroscience experiments involving eye-tracking, EEG, and other modalities.
# It integrates with hardware and software tools such as Pupil Labs, Emobit,
# and MilliKey MH5, providing a unified command-line interface and interactive
# menu system for experiment management.
