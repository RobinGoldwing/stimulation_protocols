# XTIM ‚Äì Experimental Toolkit for Multimodal Cognitive Research

**XTIM** is a scientific framework developed to facilitate experimental research in human cognition and neuroscience. Created within the [XSCAPE Project](https://www.incipit.csic.es/en/project/xscape) by CSIC-INCIPIT, it provides a robust, modular CLI for designing, running, and managing multimodal experiments involving **eye-tracking**, **EEG**, **physiological sensors**, and **behavioral response systems**.

---

## üß† Scientific Motivation

In contemporary cognitive science and experimental psychology, the need for **synchronized multimodal data collection** is more critical than ever. XTIM addresses this need by offering a **command-line-based orchestration system** capable of:

- Presenting complex visual stimuli
- Recording behavioral and physiological data
- Coordinating across devices with microsecond-level accuracy
- Enabling structured metadata and reproducibility

XTIM supports cognitive tasks that require precision timing, dynamic environments, and flexible design ‚Äî serving studies on **attention**, **perception**, **learning**, **sensorimotor integration**, and **decision-making**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

XTIM is structured into modular components, all accessible via a unified CLI powered by [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/). Key features include:

- **Cookiecutter Templates** for creating fully structured experiments
- **Configuration system** using TOML/YAML files
- **Integration** with Pupil Labs eye trackers, Emobit, MilliKey, and LSL
- **Device manager**, asset tools, menu system, export and archive utilities
- **Cross-platform** support via shell and PowerShell installers

## üî¨ Scientific Devices Supported

| Device / Interface | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Pupil Labs (Core & Neo)** | High-precision binocular eye tracking |
| **Emobit** | Wearable physiological monitoring (HR, GSR, etc.) |
| **MilliKey MH5** | Scientific button box with TTL, USB-HID |
| **LSL (Lab Streaming Layer)** | Real-time multimodal data synchronization |

XTIM allows hybrid device integration for experiments requiring low-latency synchronization.

## üß™ Use Cases

XTIM supports a wide range of experimental designs:

- Visual stimuli in screen-based cognitive tests
- Scene-based exploration in head-mounted displays
- Reaction-time studies with precise stimulus-response control
- Emotional/physiological response mapping
- Neurophenomenology experiments using multimodal datasets
